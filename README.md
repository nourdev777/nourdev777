### 🌟 About Me
I’m a graduate of the **Common Core** program at [42 Abu Dhabi](https://42abudhabi.ae/), where I honed my skills through challenging, hands-on projects. I’m seeking an **internship** to kickstart my tech journey and bring my enthusiasm to real-world problems. Recently, I’ve started diving into **artificial intelligence** — it’s the future, and I want to be part of it!
