# Hi, I’m Nour! 👋

I’m a graduate of the Common Core program at 42 Abu Dhabi — a unique coding school where I built a solid foundation in programming through hands-on projects. I’m seeking an internship to apply my skills and grow in the tech world. Passionate about artificial intelligence and eager to learn more!

### What I Can Do
- **C**: Built my own library (libft), implemented printf(), get_next_line(), push_swap sorter, a 2D game, minishell, and multi-threaded philosophers.
- **C++**: Explored OOP and developed an IRC server.
- **Web Development**: Collaborated on a team project — a website featuring a Pong game and tournament system (Django, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Tools**: Familiar with Bash, VMs, and Docker-compose.

### My Projects
- **[libft](link)** — My custom C library.
- **[minishell](link)** — A command-line shell with parsing.
- **[Pong Website](link)** — A web app with a tournament system (team effort).

### About Me
- I enjoy tackling complex challenges and collaborating with others.
- I’m diving into AI — excited about its potential!
- Open to new technologies and opportunities.
